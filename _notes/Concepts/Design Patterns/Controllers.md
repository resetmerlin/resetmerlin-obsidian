1. Routes should point to controller methods because the controller acts as the intermediary between the model, which represents the data, and the view, which displays the data. 

2. The controller method handles the incoming request, retrieves the necessary data from the model, and passes it to the view to be displayed to the user. 

3. By defining the routes to point to controller methods, it allows for separation of concerns and clean architecture, as well as efficient and maintainable code. 

4. Additionally, it enables reusability of the controller methods for multiple routes, reducing the need for duplicate code.
