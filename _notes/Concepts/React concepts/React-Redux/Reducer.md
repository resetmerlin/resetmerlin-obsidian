1. What is Reducer?
	- A reducer in React-Redux is a pure function that takes the current state and an action as input, and returns a new state. The state is updated based on the action type and the data associated with it.

	- It is used to manage the state of a React application by processing the actions and returning a new state. ***Reducers are used with the `dispatch` method of the Redux store to update the state of the application.
