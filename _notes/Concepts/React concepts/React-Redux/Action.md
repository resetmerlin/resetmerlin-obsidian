1. An action in Redux is an object that represents an event that has occurred in your application and the state changes that should result from that event.

2. It is a plain JavaScript object that represents a specific event or change in the state of your application. Actions are used to communicate information about state changes from your application to the Redux store.

3. An action must have a `type` property, which is a string that describes the type of action being performed. The `type` property is used to determine how the state should be updated in response to the action. The action may also include a `payload` property, which contains additional data that provides information about the state change being performed.
