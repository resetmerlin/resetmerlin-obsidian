1. What is Constants?

	- In the context of React-Redux, a constant is a variable that holds a value that will not change throughout the application's lifecycle. 

	- Constants are often used in Redux as action types, which are string values that describe the type of action being performed in the application. 
	
	- These constants are used to ***identify specific actions in the Redux store and in action creators, which are functions that create and dispatch actions to the store. 
	
	- Constants can help improve the readability and maintainability of a React-Redux application by allowing developers to clearly identify the purpose of each action.
