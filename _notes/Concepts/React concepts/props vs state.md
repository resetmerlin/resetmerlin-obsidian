1. In React, props (short for "properties") are a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component. Props are immutable(불변), meaning they cannot be changed within the child component.

2. State, on the other hand, is used to track changes to a component's data. It is also used to store data that can change within a component. Unlike props, state can be updated within a component using the `setState` method.

3. In summary, props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component, and state is used to track changes to a component's data and store data that can change within the component.
