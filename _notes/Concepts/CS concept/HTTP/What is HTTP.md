1. HTTP?
	- HTTP is a [[stateless protocol]]

	- HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is a protocol for transmitting data over the Internet. It is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.

	- HTTP is used for transmitting data from a web server to a web browser, and vice versa, allowing users to access and exchange information through the Internet. 
	
	- When you enter a URL into your web browser, your browser sends an HTTP request to the server hosting the website, asking for the content of the page. The server then sends an HTTP response back to the browser with the content of the page.

	- HTTP defines the structure of messages that are sent between clients (such as a web browser) and servers, and the rules for how the data should be transmitted and processed. 
	
	- HTTP uses a request/response model, where a client sends a request to a server, and the server returns a response. The request and response are formatted as HTTP messages, which consist of a header and a body. The header contains information such as the type of request, the desired content format, and the required response format. The body contains the actual data being transmitted.

2. HTTP is used by many different applications or technologies:

	-   Web browsers (e.g. Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, etc.) to retrieve and display web pages and other resources on the internet.
    
	-   Web servers (e.g. Apache, Nginx, Microsoft IIS, etc.) to receive and respond to requests from clients (e.g. web browsers) and serve web pages and other resources.
    
	-   REST APIs (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interfaces) to provide programmatic access to data and functionality over the internet.
    
	-   Mobile applications to communicate with servers and retrieve or send data over the internet.
    
	-   Internet of Things (IoT) devices to communicate with other devices or servers over the internet.
    
	-   And many other types of applications and technologies.
