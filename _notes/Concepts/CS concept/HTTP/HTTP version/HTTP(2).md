1. What is HTTP/2?
	- HTTP/2 is the latest version of the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) communication protocol. It was standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in 2015 and is a significant improvement over the previous version of the protocol, HTTP/1.1.

	- HTTP/2 was designed to address the limitations and inefficiencies of HTTP/1.1, particularly for modern web applications that make use of a large number of assets, such as images, scripts, and stylesheets.
- 
	- The HTTP/2 binary framing mechanism has been designed to not require any alteration of the APIs or config files applied: it is broadly transparent to the user.

2. Some of the key features of HTTP/2 include:

	-   Binary format: HTTP/2 uses a binary format, as opposed to the text-based format of HTTP/1.1, which leads to more efficient and faster data transfer.
    
	-   Multiplexing: HTTP/2 enables multiple requests to be sent in parallel over a single connection, reducing the overhead of multiple connections and reducing latency.
    
	-   Server Push: HTTP/2 allows servers to proactively send assets to clients, reducing the number of round trips required for a complete page load.
    
	-   Header compression: HTTP/2 includes built-in header compression, reducing the size of headers and increasing the efficiency of the data transfer.
    

HTTP/2 is supported by all major web browsers and is gradually becoming the standard for web communication. By using HTTP/2, websites can load faster and provide a better user experience, especially on slower network connections.
