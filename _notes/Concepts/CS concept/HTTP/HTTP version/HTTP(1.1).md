1. What is HTTP/1.1?

	- 11th version of the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) protocol. It's a standardized protocol for transmitting data over the internet and is used to communicate between a client (such as a web browser) and a server (such as a web server).

	- HTTP/1.1 was first defined in the Request for Comments (RFC) 2616 by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in 1999 and became a widely adopted standard for the web. 

2. Some of the key features of HTTP/1.1 include:

	-   Persistent Connections: The ability to reuse a single TCP connection to send multiple HTTP requests, improving performance by reducing overhead from creating new connections for each request.
    
	-   Chunked Transfer Encoding: A mechanism for sending data in small chunks, allowing a server to start sending data to a client even before it knows the full size of the response.
    
	-   Improved Caching: Better support for caching and conditional requests, allowing clients to make more efficient use of cached responses.
    
	-   Byte Ranges: The ability for a client to request specific byte ranges of a resource, useful for things like playing audio or video files.

3. HTTP/1.1 is still widely used today, and many websites and web applications still rely on it for their communication. However, with the growing need for faster and more efficient data transfer, a new version of the protocol, [[HTTP(2)]], was introduced in 2015 and is gradually being adopted.
