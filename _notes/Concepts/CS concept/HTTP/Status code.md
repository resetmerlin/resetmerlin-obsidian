1. What is Status code?
	- HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) status codes are three-digit numbers that are used to indicate the status or outcome of an HTTP request. They provide information about the outcome of an HTTP request and can be used by clients (such as web browsers) and servers to diagnose and debug problems with the communication.

	-   200 OK: The request was successful, and the server has returned the requested data.

	-   201 Created: The request was successful, and the server has created a new resource as a result.

	-   204 No Content: The request was successful, but there is no data to return.

	-   400 Bad Request: The request was malformed or invalid, and the server cannot process it.

	-   401 Unauthorized: The request requires authentication, and the client did not provide valid credentials.

	-   403 Forbidden: The client does not have sufficient permission to access the requested resource.

	-   404 Not Found: The server could not find the requested resource.

	-   500 Internal Server Error: An error occurred on the server, and it could not fulfill the request.

There are many other HTTP status codes that can be used to indicate different types of results and error conditions. In general, HTTP status codes are used to communicate the outcome of an HTTP request and to help clients and servers diagnose and debug problems with the communication.
