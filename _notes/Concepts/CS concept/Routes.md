1. In web development, a route is a URL pattern that is associated with a specific function in the server-side code. When a client makes a request to the server using a specific URL, the server maps the URL to the corresponding route, which then invokes the associated function to handle the request. 

2. The function performs any necessary operations (such as retrieving data from a database or calling another API) and returns a response, which is sent back to the client.
