1. What is BEM?: BEM attempts to divide the overall user interface into small reusable components


 Example, there is a stick man that u want to style.
	1.  You should name it Stick man in to 'stick-man'
	2.  Now You want to style the head of stick man. Head is basically element of stick man. So u should give name like this: 'stick-man__head'. Easy right?  the E in ‘BEM’ stands for Elements.
	3.  If you want to style modifier of stick man, u should give name like: 'stick-man--blue'. The M in ‘BEM’ stands for Modifiers.
